Companies typically spend millions of dollars each year developing strategic plans that outline product branding, studying consumer behavior as well as performing cognitive walkthroughs to determine whether their product or service is viable to reach its target audience. However, Tesla remains an outlier in this regard; they spend $0 in traditional advertising yet remain the most valuable automotive company in the world by market capitalization. In this social media content study, we will examine the target users for the Tesla Model 3, organic and paid content that can be used to market the HCI product/experience and examine findings regarding the Model 3, competitors and how engaging and persuasive our social media content was with our target audience. \n            <br></br><br></br>\n            As mentioned in the persona for the Tesla Model 3, the target user audience for the HCI product/experience are mid-high income individuals, due to the $35,000+ price tag for the coveted electric vehicle. The target users must also be environmentally conscious and have views about reducing our carbon footprint and clean energy that aligns with that of Tesla. The Model 3 aims to target the 25-35 age demographic (young adults and professionals) looking to upgrade from their first car to a more sustainable and luxurious electric vehicle. The Model 3 also appeals to the 35-55 age demographic, individuals who are looking to make a change in their lives by upgrading to an EV that can last for 10 years. Such individuals in the 25-55 age demographic must also be conscious about how they spend their money and would typically look at the Tesla Model 3 as an investment into a clean and green future rather than just a luxury vehicle. \n            <br></br><br></br>\n            The target users must also be advocates of technology and social media; Tesla vehicles are autonomous, connect seamlessly with smartphones and boast a 15 inch touchscreen that allows for ease of access to all of the vehicle features, social media as well as games. Due to the “high tech” nature of the Model 3 as well as the rest of Tesla’s vehicles, the target audience would need enough domain knowledge of the Internet and using technology to fully immerse themselves in the Tesla Model 3 experience (as opposed to individuals who still use flip phones and drive simple motor vehicles). Lastly, the target users want the freedom to explore the unknown with their Tesla Model 3; with autonomous driving, a distributed map of superchargers around the world and 0-60 mph speed in 3.1s, the consumer can explore with minimal effort and have all the luxurious and comforts that the Model 3 provides while doing so. \n            </p>\n            </div>\n            <hr></hr>\n            <h3 data-aos=\"fade-down\">Social Media Content</h3>\n            <br></br>\n            <h4 data-aos=\"fade-left\">Organic Content</h4>\n            <p>FACEBOOK:</p>\n            <img data-aos=\"fade-right\" src={img1} alt=\"\" className=\"fb-images\"></img>\n            <p data-aos=\"fade-right\" className=\"content-p\">This Facebook post was made by Christian Buehner Photography, an individual who fits the persona of a Tesla Model 3 target user, in the 25-35 age demographic. This organic social media post shows a target user who recently purchased the product and is now sharing a high-quality photograph of the product on his photography page. The caption has positive sentiment towards the product/experience and would be shared across Facebook to others following Christian Buehner Photography. </p>\n            <br></br><br></br>\n            <p>INSTAGRAM:</p>\n            <img src={img2} alt=\"\" className=\"ig-images\"></img>\n            <p className=\"content-p\">This Instagram post was made by Meritt Thomas, another target user in the 25-35 age demographic who recently just purchased a new Tesla Model 3. She posts her dog, Sparky, putting his head out of the window with a Tesla supercharger in the background. This social media post shares with Meritt’s network of friends on Instagram that she is loving her new electric vehicle, while promoting Tesla’s product and brand to her followers. The caption exhibits positive sentiment and is empathetic and relatable to other individuals who fall within the target audience.</p>\n            <br></br><br></br>\n            <p>TWITTER:</p>\n            <img src={img3} alt=\"\" className=\"twtr-images\"></img>\n            <p className=\"content-p\">This tweet on Twitter was made by Elon Musk, CEO and Founder of Tesla Motors. While some may say that this post is along the lines of sponsored content, this is actually an organic post, due to the fact that Elon Musk is very active on social media and tends to voice his opinions. This social media post features a clean white Tesla Model 3 parked up at the Tesla Gigafactory in Austin by Elon Musk and shows positive sentiment towards the product/experience. Due to how influential Elon Musk is, this would directly market the product to the target audience, those who fit the persona for the Model 3 and those who follow him on Twitter.</p>\n            <br></br><br></br>\n            <h4>Paid Content</h4>\n            <br></br><br></br>\n            <p>FACEBOOK:</p>\n            <img src={img4} alt=\"\" className=\"fb-images\"></img>\n            <p className=\"content-p\">In this paid post by Tesla on Facebook, they promote the interior of the Tesla Model 3, by marketing it as a “Sleek interior built around the driver”. They supplement their claim about building an interior experience built around the driver by specifying that the 15-inch touchscreen display allows for access to all driver controls. This social media post has high engagement, allows for potential customers to learn more about the product by being forwarded to Tesla’s website and shows that the product is “Available Near You”, to let the target audience know that they can purchase a Tesla Model 3. </p>\n            <br></br><br></br>\n            <p>INSTAGRAM:</p>\n            <img src={img5} alt=\"\" className=\"ig-images\"></img>\n            <p className=\"content-p\">This sponsored Instagram post by Tesla shows the Tesla keycard, which can be used to unlock your Tesla Model 3. This is a product that is available across all vehicles so the hashtags will refer to all models that Tesla has available. The caption “Tap to unlock. Go anywhere.” means that with a tap of the card, the target user can unlock their Tesla and use it to go explore. The caption is simple, easily-understood and motivates the user to “Go anywhere.” with their Tesla Model 3. </p>\n            <br></br><br></br>\n            <p>TWITTER:</p>\n            <img src={img6} alt=\"\" className=\"twtr-images\"></img>\n            <p className=\"content-p\">This sponsored tweet on Twitter by Tesla shows a Tesla supercharger and provides factual information about how many superchargers there are in the US and around the world. The caption also mentions that Tesla plans to add over 1000 stations around in the world this year, which shows the target user that if they do purchase a Model 3, they will have enough superchargers along their route to recharge their vehicle. The phrase “Charge anywhere, go anywhere.” has positive, forward-moving sentiment, which makes the target user feel that with a Tesla Model 3, they have the convenience of superchargers all around the world, giving them the luxury of exploring while reducing their carbon footprint. </p>\n            <hr></hr>\n            <h3>Research</h3>\n            <p class=\"abstract\">Tesla is currently one of the most sought after electric vehicles in the world, yet they spend $0 on traditional advertising. According to mediakix.com, they have no advertising team or advertising agency they use to market their products. In 2021, automotive companies are expected to spend over $13 billion on digital advertising and marketing (Source: Statista). Below, you will find 2015 advertising spending (via mediakix.com), which shows how much Tesla competitors spent on advertising and marketing as opposed to Tesla’s $0.</p>\n            <p class=\"abstract\">There are many reasons why Tesla can survive despite having no advertising budget. One of the main reasons is CEO and Founder Elon Musk. Elon Musk, in my opinion, is a visionary and is very skilled at engineering sleek products that tend to market themselves. His Twitter account has very high user engagement and is used to market Tesla’s newest products as well as provide the product’s target audience with information about Tesla’s upcoming products and services. \n            An instance of Tesla’s low-cost marketing strategy was the David Dobrik Tesla Giveaway, where he gave away 5 Tesla Model 3s via Instagram. This giveaway was not affiliated with Tesla, rather David Dobrik, an Instagram influencer with over 14 million followers, who was able to generate tens of millions of story shares of the coveted electric vehicle. This goes to show that Tesla’s product/experience is unique enough to the point where it tends to market itself (with the right amount of social media marketing through Tesla’s accounts as well as through Elon Musk’s promotion on Twitter).\n            In our social media campaign, we hope to use non traditional marketing and advertising strategies that have fared Tesla very well in the past. Using social media influencers to promote the HCI product/experience, using positive sentiment in social media posts as well as informing the target audience about developments at Tesla will bolster the Model 3’s marketability through social media channels. \n            </p>\n            <hr></hr>\n            <h3>Approach</h3>\n            <p class=\"abstract\">There are several reasons why our social media content and campaign is human-centered. First and foremost, the aesthetics of the HCI product/experience and the content. The Tesla Model 3 and it’s images are aesthetically pleasing and appeal to the target audience that falls in the 25-55 demographic that is environmentally conscious, technology advocates and those in the mid-high income bracket. Next, the information architecture of the content makes it easy for the user to learn more about the product/experience by allowing them to explore the product more in-depth on the Tesla website. Lastly, the content demonstrates ease of use in regard to the HCI product/experience. The distributed network of superchargers around the world, sleek and simple keycard to unlock the Model 3 as well as the human-centered interior built around the driver featuring the 15-inch touch screen makes it easier for the target user to get started and on the road with the Model 3.\n            In order to drive engagement and persuade the target user to engage with the content, we used positive sentiment and highly-aesthetic images for the organic content and informative captions for the paid content. The organic content features the photography page promotes the Model 3 by sharing a highly-visual photograph of the vehicle with his followers on Facebook. Similarly, the Instagram post features a very empathetic post about being able to go on adventures with one's dog (extends to friends and family) with a supercharger in the background. Lastly, Elon Musk’s tweet about the Model 3 parked at the Tesla Gigafactory in Austin shows that even the Founder and CEO is enjoying the product. Altogether, the use of positive sentiment amongst the target audience’s social media network of friends as well as the use of empathy and highly-aesthetic images will aid in driving impressions and engagements on social media platforms for organic user content as part of our measurement strategy.\n            For paid and sponsored content by Tesla, we would use more informative captions alongside highly-visual images of the Tesla Model 3 product/experience. For the Facebook post, we use an image of the interior and inform the target audience about the features that are present in the interior. Similarly, we create an Instagram post about the keycard allowing the target user to “Tap to unlock. Go anywhere”, informing them that with a single tap of the card, one can use a Tesla 3 to go anywhere. Lastly, the tweet by Tesla informing the target audience on Twitter about their plans regarding supercharger expansion aims to persuade users to purchase a Tesla so that they too can “Charge anywhere, go anywhere”. In short, the use of factual information about the product/experience to inform and persuade the target audience will drive impressions and engagements on social media platforms for paid content as part of our measurement strategy.\n            </p>\n            <br></br><br></br>\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default SocialMedia;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
